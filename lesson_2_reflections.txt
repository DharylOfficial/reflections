What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, you create a .git folder. This allows you to commit files so that you can go back to previous versions. You need to do this because this is the whole point of using a version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where files go from the working directory before being saved in the repository. It's value is that it allows the options of multiple files to be added, or edited, in one commit.
